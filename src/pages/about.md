I am currently based in Seattle, Washington, United States, where I have lived since 2012 after
graduating from the [University of Michigan](https://umich.edu) with dual bachelor's degrees in
music and computer engineering.

# Tech industry

I work as a software engineer with a focus on user interfaces. For more about my
professional activities, visit my [LinkedIn profile](https://linkedin.com/in/andrewbr).

# Music

I have been playing the piano for over 30 years, focusing mostly on classical music with a heavy
side dose of jazz, musical theatre, and video game music. I play regularly throughout the community,
and at times I have also taught private piano lessons.
