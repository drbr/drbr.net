I am currently based in Seattle, Washington, United States, where I moved in 2012 after graduating
from the [University of Michigan](https://umich.edu).

In my professional life as a software engineer, I am passionate about building intuitive user
interfaces and developer tools, with over a decade of experience working on frontend at
[Tableau](https://www.tableau.com/), [Snowflake](https://www.snowflake.com/), and
[Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/). I enjoy helping people learn to code, especially during my time
as a volunteer teacher with [TEALS](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/teals). For more about my
professional activities, visit my [LinkedIn profile](https://linkedin.com/in/andrewbr).

As a pianist for over 30 years, I believe that the arts are an indispensable part of life. I
regularly perform, arrange, and jam, focusing mainly on classical, jazz, musical theatre, and video
game music. At times, I have also taught private piano lessons to adults.

When I'm not at the computer or the piano, I enjoy cooking for friends, solving the daily NYT
crossword puzzle, drinking tea, and riding my bicycle all over the Seattle area.
