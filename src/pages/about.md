I am currently based in Seattle, Washington, United States, where I moved in 2012 after graduating
from the [University of Michigan](https://umich.edu).

# Tech industry

In my professional life as a software engineer, I build intuitive tools and user interfaces. I have
over a decade of experience as a frontend engineer at [Tableau](https://www.tableau.com/),
[Snowflake](https://www.snowflake.com/), and [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/). I have enjoyed
helping people learn to code, especially as a volunteer teacher with
[TEALS](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/teals). For more information about my professional
activities, visit my [LinkedIn profile](https://linkedin.com/in/andrewbr).

# Music

As a pianist with over 30 years of experience, I believe that the arts are an indispensable part of
life. I regularly perform, arrange, and jam, focusing mainly on classical music, jazz, video game
music, and musical theatre. At times, I have taught private piano lessons to adults.
